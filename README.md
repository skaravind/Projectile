# Projectile
A simple app to visualise a projectile. (Made for my sister who was having problems to understand the concept of projectile motion)

Install Processing.py and open "projectile.pyde" to add changes to the behaviour of projectile.

Both Mac and Win64 apps included in the repo, pull all files in the folder of your desired version and play!
